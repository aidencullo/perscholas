This project is a simple web application for lottery registration. It allows users to enter their details to participate in a lottery. The form collects user information, including full name, email, phone number, and age, and includes a checkbox to agree to the terms and conditions.

The application also features a dark mode toggle button, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes.
